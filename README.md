# Wellness App

### What is this?
Eventbrite shows tons of health-related events in a huge variety of genres, from educational talks to meditation and group workouts, and everything in-between. This app exposes that variety to users on a simple Google Map to help persuade them to attend these events and invest in their well-being.

In a vastly growing tech-world, having products which keeps users’ health in mind shows compassion and empathy which other companies may not be investing in. Matter of fact, scrolling through Eventbrite’s Twitter feed shows a lot of tweets which are aimed at helping users grow - as hosts and as people - so anything Health-related does not seem far-fetched.

Bringing attention to Health-related events matters because many people - even outside of the tech world - are sitting, stationary, and staring at their computer screens. Any technology which also helps us get away from it is essential for self-care, and this wellness app is a friendly reminder of that.

### Tech:
